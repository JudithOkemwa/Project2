Bulk Data Extraction: Using Power BI’s capabilities to import large datasets from multiple sources.
Data Cleaning
Data Transformation: Cleaning and preparing datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Error Handling: Identifying and rectifying inconsistencies and errors in the data.
Data Modeling
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Creating complex calculated columns and measures to enhance data analysis.
Relationship Management: Establishing and managing relationships between different tables to create a robust data model.
Data Analysis
Advanced Analytics: Utilizing Power BI’s analytical tools to uncover insights and trends within the data.
Pivot Table Analysis: Conducting in-depth data analysis using pivot tables.
Data Visualization
Interactive Dashboards: Creating dynamic and interactive dashboards for data presentation.
Custom Visuals: Implementing custom visuals to enhance data storytelling and user engagement.
KPI Dashboards: Developing Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dashboards for performance monitoring.
Report Development
