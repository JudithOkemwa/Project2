Welcome to my Power BI project repository! 
This project showcases my expertise in using Power BI for data analysis and visualization. The data-sets sets "Bank-Owned ATM locations in New York State" and "Annual Population Estimates for New York State and Counties" are sourced from the data.gov website.  The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate advanced skills in data mining, cleaning, modeling, analysis, and visualization using Power BI.

Skills Demonstrated

Data Mining and Extraction
Power Query: Efficiently extracting and transforming data directly from web sources.
Bulk Data Extraction: Using Power BI’s capabilities to import large datasets from multiple sources.

Data Cleaning
Data Transformation: Cleaning and preparing datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Identifying and rectifying inconsistencies and errors in the data.

Data Modeling
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Creating complex calculated columns and measures to enhance data analysis.
Relationship Management: Establishing and managing relationships between different tables to create a robust data model.

Data Analysis
Advanced Analytics: Utilizing Power BI’s analytical tools to uncover insights and trends within the data.
Pivot Table Analysis: Conducting in-depth data analysis using pivot tables.

Data Visualization
